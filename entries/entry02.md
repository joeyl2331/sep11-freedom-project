# Entry 2: Changing and tinkering new tool
##### 12/12/2022

### Content
The tool I chose initially is [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) but after tinkering with it, I figured that it wasn’t the right tool for my freedom project. So I went back to the [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJFrErlAZvB-0V923QGOm4X3CwiceJsKot2R6Jz8Mdc/preview) with all the different lists of tools to choose from and chose [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/). Kaboom would be a better choice because it is more efficient in helping make games, which is what I want. While ThreeJS, mainly focuses on 3d models and 3d scenes. I saw that for Kaboom, I can make the characters/objects move around by clicking on the screen or using the keyboards.

### From Kaboom Website
When looking through the different examples inside the kaboom playground, what surprised me the most is that you can replace a sprite with a symbol so that you don’t have to continue typing the sprite ( which is more convenient).
EX: From scenes (included inside the playground)
```java
const LEVELS = [
	[
		"@  ^ $$ >",
		"=========",
	],
]
```
This shows: Like ![img of something](../tinker-img/scene.png)



### EDP
The engineering design process I am at right now is to plan the most promising solution and test and evaluate the prototype because I am choosing and securing the most suitable tool to help build my freedom project and tinkering with that tool by making mini challenges myself.

### Skills
The skills I learned while learning my tool are collaboration and communication because, for this freedom project, I am working with a partner. Me and my partner learned to rely on each other for help and ask peers when we are stuck.

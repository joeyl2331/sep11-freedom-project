### Expo elevator pitch
One takeaway from the expo is that the judges and the students that have visited our product suggests us to add more levels. Another takeaway is to have a scene dedicated to prize selection, where the player gets to choose their prize depending on the amount of coins they have collected from the game. It is because I saw some students who collects all the coins on each level for the game.

### In-class presentation
One takeaway I had from the presentation is to put in effort to create a more unique and effective hook. Another takeaway I had is to have more eye contact with the audience. Overall I think I did good on the presentation because I spoke clearly and cooperated well with my partner to give the presentation.

### EDP + Skills
The engineering design process I am at right now is "communicating the result". It is because we have completed making our product that we worked a year on. Now we are proudly showing it off to the students and teachers in the school. The skills I learned are collaboration and communication. It is because my partner and I have split the work on who works on what slide to our presentation and when we are showing off our project, me and my partner made sure that we give our undivided attention when presenting our product to other people.

# Entry 1 : Deciding to learn ThreeJS
##### 11/7/2022

### Content
After two weeks of looking at the different tools I could use for my freedom project, I have decided to use ThreeJs. I chose [Three Js](https://threejs.org/) because Three JS can be used to make animations of moving objects, 3d models, and 3d scenes. Texture and shading can also be added to the 3d models which will make the outcome of the product look nice. [This website](https://r105.threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-backgrounds.html) shows me how I can insert an image as a background with Three Js. [This website](https://r105.threejsfundamentals.org/threejs/lessons/threejs-fundamentals.html) shows me the code of how to make 3d shapes like cubes with ThreeJS.    
 
The year-long project that I am going to make with Three Js is collecting stars. At first my idea was hide and seek but then I changed my idea to a game where the purpose is to collect an amount of stars in a limited amount of time.

### EDP
The engineering design process I am at right now is researching the problem and brainstorming possible solutions because the first task of the year-long project is to find a tool and think of an idea of what I want to make with the tool.
 
### Skills
The skills I learned while learning my tool is How to learn and embracing failures because I was on my own to decide what tool I want to use and to learn and tinker about the tool.

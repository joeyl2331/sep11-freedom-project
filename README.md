# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Joey Lin

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about X. The purpose of this blog is to X.

## Content
For my project, I am making a platformer game where the goal is for players to collect keys and avoid touching the enemy to successfully go to the next level. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying [KaboomJs](https://kaboomjs.com/) in order to make my platformer game.

## Implications
The game that I created has both negative and positive impacts on society. It contributes to the categories of global, social, and economic. The game has a global impact because instead of people wasting paper to play games like tic tac-toe and hangman on it, they can save paper and play games on either their phone, computer, or tablet. The game has a social impact because it can make people happy when they play together with their friends. The game has economic impact because as the world is advancing, technology is too. This means that more money is earned from games being created. However there are also negative impacts of games. There is going to be more competition in the creation of games. More games can make some people lose focus in their work and become addicted to playing games instead.
